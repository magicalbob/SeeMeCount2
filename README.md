See-Me-Choose
=============

This app was written for my son who has profound learning difficulties and no speech, to entertain him and help with his development. The app is a number matching game, which displays the one to nine picture of one of nine animals and states the number of animals there are. It displays the digits one to nine around the edges.

If the user presses the digit for the number of animals displayed, the app plays a success message then restarts the game. No feedback is given for pressing the wrong digits, as my son would be entertained by that!
